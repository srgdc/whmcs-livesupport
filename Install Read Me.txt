HOW TO INSTALL/UPGRADE!

	* i. is for fresh installs
	* ii. is for upgrades

1. Upload all the files in this zip to your whmcs directory.

2. Run the database install file located at:
i. http://YOUR-WHMCS-LOCATION-HERE/chat-install/install.php
ii. http://YOUR-WHMCS-LOCATION-HERE/chat-install/upgrade.1.php

Alternatively you can manually add the sql into your database.

3. Delete the chat install folder (chat-install) after the database setup is complete.

4. Go to the chat settings page and set your desired settings as well as your license key.

-> If you do not have a license key you can aquire one from http://whmcsaddon.com
* The license key is required for this software to work.

Your chat settings page can be found here:
http://YOUR-WHMCS-LOCATION-HERE/admin/addonmodules.php?module=live_chat_settings

5. Once you have your disered settings setup you may edit your templates to include the live chat javascript.

* jQuery must be installed on your site!
** the jQuery include on your site template will look something like this:
	<script type="text/javascript" src="../includes/jscript/jquery.js"></script>
	Any javascript include will be placed after jQuery has been included!

 -- Main/WHMCS Site --

After the line that includes jQuery to the site (for WHMCS templates it is recommended to include it in the header.tpl file "/templates/YOUR-TEMPLATE-HERE/header.tpl"):
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://YOUR-WHMCS-LOCATION-HERE/includes/jscript/livehelp.js.php"></script>

Put this where you want your icons to appear in your layout:
<span class="livechat"></span>


!IMPORTANT THIS HAS BEEN UPDATED!
 -- Admin Area Template --
    -> This is an optional addon which will give you the ability to view live chat requests on any page in the  WHMCS admin panel.


In your admin template edit header.tpl ("/admin/templates/YOUR-TEMPLATE-HERE/header.tpl")

Insert the following line after jQuery is included
<script type="text/javascript" src="../includes/jscript/adminchat-notify.js.php?module={$smarty.get.module}"></script>
